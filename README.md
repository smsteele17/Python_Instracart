# Python_Instracart
This project is part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics course that used public data from Instacart to uncover sales patterns using Python
# Objective
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
